THIS repo is deprecated - iSAQB references will be maintained within our (internal)
subversion repo.

Public version of the document will be available at iSAQB.org in the download/document section.

This move is due to the fact that Leanpub for several reasons couldn't be chosen as
publishing platform for this content.
