The International Software Architecture Qualification Board 
(iSAQB e.V., http://isaqb.org) is a non-profit
organization with members from industry, development and consulting firms,
education, academia and other organizations.

It is established as an _association_ (e.V.) according to German law with the following objectives:

* Creating and maintaining consistent **curricula** for software architects.
* **Defining certification examinations** based upon the various CPSA curricula
* **Ensuring high quality of teaching** for software architects
* Ensuring a high quality of its software architecture certifications

iSAQB defines and prescribes training and examination regulations, but does not carry out any training or examinations itself. iSAQB trainings are carried out by (licensed) training and examination organizations.

iSAQB monitors and audits the quality of these trainings and
all associated processes (e.g. certification procedures).
