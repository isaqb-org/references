## Matthias Bohlen

Matthias Bohlen, [independent expert](http://mbohlen.de) for effective product development, started his career as a software developer in 1980. He wrote compilers for the MC68020 processor by Motorola which was quite a revolutionary device in those days where there was no IBM PC, yet. And the compilers really sold well.

Later, Matthias joined a CAD/CAM software company with 8 people and 4000 customers – this was product development from the ground up! 8 years later, after being a software developer, consulting projects were done with the CAD/CAM system, and Matthias discovered that he enjoyed to do be a consultant and work with customers.

After a few years at another 130-people consulting company, in 2001 in the middle of the dot-com bubble, he decided that it was now time to become his own boss and started to work as a freelance software architect and developer.

Since then, Matthias has worked with countless software teams, helping them to get working software out the door without losing their mind. This is what he still does today.

In times where Matthias felt his mind could use some excitement, he founded [AndroMDA](http://www.andromda.org), an open source project and (as a co-founder with Michael Mahlberg) the [Limited WIP Society Cologne](http://lwscologne.de), a community of Kanban practitioners.

Matthias is an active member of the [International Software Architecture Qualification Board](http://www.isaqb.org), writes [a blog](http://mbohlen.de), is being known in the Lean/Agile field, worked as an editor for [OBJEKTspektrum](http://www.objektspektrum.de), regularly writes for [Business Technology Magazine](https://jaxenter.de/magazine/business-technology) and speaks at conferences for software development. And he even thinks about founding another startup company – but that's a different story.

## Michael Mahlberg

Michael Mahlberg runs his own [method consultancy](http://consulting-guild.de) in Germany and spends most of his time supporting clients in their quest for more effective ways to work. Mostly by applying lean and agile concepts.

{width=20%,float=inside}
![](images/42-backmatter/MichaelMahlbergQ2-2013-BW.jpeg)

Running his own computer and software related companies since he was 18, he quickly came to realize that software architecture and (development) processes are in a way timeless aspects of the craft.

In the late eighties of the 20th century he started to incorporate these aspectts into his business activities and has worked on software architecture in large scale systems for industries as diverse as media, aerospace, insurance, public sector, telco etc.

Nowadays a lot of his work focuses on processes and human interactions – a field in which he engages both professionally as well as pro bono (for example he is one of the people who started and run the [Limited WIP Society Cologne](http://lwscologne.de)).

Michael's architectural work therefore tends to be dealing with the impact(s) and implications of architectural and process decisions _on each other_ and the relative optimization strategies.
