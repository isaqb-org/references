# Introduction

This book contains a glossary of _software architecture terminology_.

It can serve as a reference for preparation for the iSAQB e.V.
 examination
_Certified Professional for Software Architecture - Foundation Level_©.

Please be aware: This glossary is **not** intended to be a primer or course book
on software architecture, just a collection of definitions (and links to further information).

Furthermore, you find proposals for [translations](#section-translations)
of the iSAQB terminology,
currently between English and German (and vice-versa).

Finally this book contains numerous [references](#section-references) to books
and other resources, many of which we quoted in the definitions.

**This book is work in progress.**

Errors or omissions can also be reported in our issue tracker on
[Github](https://github.com/isaqb-org/glossary/issues),
where the authors maintain the original sources for this book.

## Terms Can Be Referenced

All terms in the glossary have unique URLs to the (free) online version of the book,
therefore they can be universally referenced, both from online- and print documentation.

Our URL scheme is quite simple:

* The base URL is `https://leanpub.com/isaqbglossary/read`
* We just add the prefix `#term-` in front of
the term to be referenced, then the term itself, with hyphens ("-") instead of blanks.

  For example our description of the term _software architecture_ can be referenced (hyperlinked) with
    `https://leanpub.com/isaqbglossary/read#term-software-architecture`

Nearly all terms are hyperlinked with their full names, with very few examples that
are referenced by their (common) abbreviations, like UML or DDD.
